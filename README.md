# Discord Music Bot

This is a very bare bones music bot. Although it handles playlists and queues, it does not handle HTTPS errors.

You can use Replit and UptimeBot to keep it alive.

## Commands

--help_me to see all commands on discord chat.

--play '"url"' to play a youtube video.

--play_playlist '"playlist url"' plays a youtube playlist by adding all other videos on queue.

--queue to see the current queue.

--remove_from_queue 'int: number on queue' to remove a certain video from queue.

--skip to go to the next song on queue.

--stop to stop playing audio (it does not clean up the playlist).

--leave to leave the audio channel.

--join to manually make the bot join the voice channel.

--clear_queue to clean the complete queue.
